# Avenoryn — Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Document type:** Product requirements  
**Status:** Canonical planning baseline  
**Implementation status:** Requirements baseline; current implementation status is maintained in `Context.md`.

This document is the product authority for Avenoryn. Architectural decisions belong in `SDD.md`. Phase sequencing belongs in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`. Current work state belongs in `Context.md`.

---

## 1. Product vision

Avenoryn is a unified personal life-administration system.

**Core principle:**

> Calendar tells you when. Avenoryn tells you what, why, where, and what to do next.

The product brings together personal administrative information that is normally scattered across files, emails, calendars, websites, and apps. It is a private system of record for documents, commitments, renewals, warranties, deadlines, and the actions they imply.

Avenoryn does not replace a calendar, bank, cloud drive, or chatbot. It organizes administrative life so the user can see what needs attention and how to act.

---

## 2. Problem statement

Personal administration is fragmented:

- Identity and legal documents live in folders, photos, email attachments, and government portals.
- Subscriptions, memberships, and recurring bills are billed by many vendors with different renewal dates.
- Warranties are forgotten because receipts are disconnected from products.
- Deadlines (applications, submissions, appointments) sit in notes, calendars, and messages.
- Expiry dates for passports, licences, insurance, and certifications are easy to miss.
- Taking action usually means finding the right portal URL after the reminder has already fired.

Users need one private place that answers:

- What needs my attention?
- What is this document, and is it current?
- What am I paying for, and when?
- What expires, and how do I renew it?
- What did I buy, and is it still under warranty?
- What is due, and where do I go to act?

---

## 3. Target users

**Primary user:** an individual managing their own administrative life (documents, subscriptions, bills, warranties, renewals, and deadlines).

**Initial deployment assumption:** single-user-per-account ownership. Family or shared vaults are out of MVP and post-MVP until explicitly planned.

**Non-users (initially):** households as first-class shared entities, organizations, and enterprise teams.

---

## 4. Product areas

### 4.1 Home / Action Center

The primary dashboard answers: **“What needs my attention?”**

It aggregates:

- overdue items
- upcoming deadlines
- document expirations
- renewals
- subscription renewals
- recurring payments
- warranty expirations
- important actions

### 4.2 Vault

A private repository for personal documents, including (examples, not a closed list):

- passport, PAN, Aadhaar, driving licence, college ID
- certificates
- insurance documents
- agreements
- invoices and receipts
- other personal documents

Documents have structured metadata and version history.

### 4.3 Commitments

Manage:

- subscriptions
- recurring payments
- memberships

Examples: Netflix, Spotify, YouTube Premium, Google One, iCloud, gym, electricity, internet, mobile, rent, insurance, EMI.

### 4.4 Renewals

Manage lifecycle-based items:

- passport, driving licence, insurance, domain, certifications, memberships, licences

### 4.5 Warranties

Connect: **Purchase → Receipt → Product → Warranty → Expiry**

### 4.6 Deadlines

Examples: college applications, scholarship applications, project submissions, appointments, document submissions, internship applications.

### 4.7 Life Timeline

A chronological view aggregating:

- deadlines
- renewals
- subscriptions
- recurring payments
- warranties
- document expirations

### 4.8 Financial commitments

Show expected recurring commitments over:

- next 7 days
- next 30 days
- next 365 days

This is **not** a budgeting, investment, or financial-advice application.

### 4.9 Life Inbox

Users can dump PDFs, receipts, invoices, screenshots, notices, and scanned documents.

Initially these are manually reviewed and categorized. Later, AI may suggest classifications and extracted information.

### 4.10 Document intelligence (post-MVP)

Optional local OCR and text extraction can extract document text without an AI provider. Structured AI suggestions are optional; AI output is a **suggestion**. The user must Confirm / Edit / Reject. When the provider is disabled or fails, extracted text remains available and the UI must report that suggestions were not produced.

Example: insurance PDF → provider, policy number, start date, expiry date.

### 4.11 Receipt intelligence (post-MVP)

Potential workflow: Receipt → OCR → extracted purchase information → user confirmation → Purchase → Warranty.

### 4.12 Document versioning

Documents must support current version, previous versions, version number, upload date, and replacement history.

### 4.13 Action URLs

Records may contain external URLs for the relevant official action (renew passport, manage subscription, pay bill, renew insurance, renew domain).

Avenoryn must **not** pretend to perform an external action unless an actual integration exists.

### 4.14 Global command center

`Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K`.

Examples:

- show everything expiring in the next 30 days
- how much recurring money is due this month?
- find my laptop invoice
- what needs attention this week?
- show active subscriptions

MVP may use deterministic commands/search. Natural-language AI can be added later.

### 4.15 Search

Search across documents, purchases, subscriptions, warranties, deadlines, renewals, recurring payments, and notes/metadata.

### 4.16 Notifications

Reminders for deadlines, renewals, subscription payments, recurring payments, warranties, and document expiry.

Initial implementation: in-app notifications. Email can be added later.

---

## 10. UX principles

- Primary question on Home: “What needs my attention?”
- Modern, minimal, professional, responsive, calm, classy, visually consistent.
- Do not create an overcrowded enterprise dashboard.
- Action URLs are honest: they open the official destination; Avenoryn does not fake the action.
- AI, when present, is a suggestion layer with explicit Confirm / Edit / Reject.
- Protected application areas: Home, Vault, Commitments, Timeline, Inbox.
- Authentication screens: Login, Register.
- Protected routes: `/app/home`, `/app/vault`, `/app/commitments`, `/app/timeline`, `/app/inbox`.

Inbox UI may exist as a route shell before Life Inbox is fully implemented; full inbox capability is post-MVP per Section 8 and `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.

---

## 11. Acceptance criteria (product-level)

The product is acceptably specified when:

1. A user can register, log in, and access only their own data.
2. A user can store versioned documents in a private vault with metadata.
3. A user can manage subscriptions, recurring payments, purchases, warranties, renewals, and deadlines.
4. Action Center answers what needs attention from those records.
5. Timeline shows those events chronologically.
6. Financial overview shows recurring commitments for 7 / 30 / 365 days without becoming a budgeting app.
7. Search finds records across the listed entity types.
8. Action URLs open external destinations without pretending Avenoryn completed the action.
9. Files are never publicly accessible; ownership is always checked.
10. The system remains usable without AI.
11. Scope boundaries in Section 12 are not violated.

Phase-level acceptance criteria are in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.

---

## 12. Scope boundaries

Avenoryn is **not** initially:

- a banking application
- a budgeting application
- an investment platform
- a tax platform
- a password manager
- a cloud drive replacement
- a full email client
- a calendar replacement
- a social network
- simply an AI chatbot

AI is an intelligence layer over the administrative system.

Do not add unrelated features merely because they sound interesting. Do not invent requirements beyond this SRS and the paired `SDD.md` / `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
