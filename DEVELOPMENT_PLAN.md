# Avenoryn Development Plan

**Plan status:** Consolidated final roadmap
**Last updated:** 2026-10-11
**Final planned phase:** Phase 16 — Production Hardening + Release

Avenoryn is an individual life-administration system for private documents, commitments, purchases, renewals, deadlines, and the actions around them. This plan records the completed project in its final planned scope. It does not define additional product phases.

## Phase status

| Phase | Name | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Project Initialization | Complete |
| 1 | Design System + Application Shell | Complete |
| 2 | Database + Backend Foundation | Complete |
| 3 | Authentication + Authorization | Complete |
| 4 | Core Avenoryn Data Model | Complete |
| 5 | Vault + Documents | Complete |
| 6 | Document Versioning | Complete |
| 7 | Commitments | Complete |
| 8 | Purchases + Warranties | Complete |
| 9 | Renewals + Deadlines | Complete |
| 10 | Action Center | Complete |
| 11 | Timeline | Complete |
| 12 | Financial Commitments | Complete |
| 13 | Search + Life Inbox | Complete |
| 14 | AI Intelligence | Complete |
| 15 | Command Center + Notifications | Complete |
| 16 | Production Hardening + Release | Final planned phase |

Phase 16 is complete only after required checks and security review pass, final documentation and tracked-file audits are complete, a final commit is created, and the intended `master` branch is successfully published and verified. The actual release state belongs in `Context.md`.

The final quality pass is tracked as release hardening within Phase 16. Avenoryn is the selected product identity; the public-web name screen is documented in `docs/NAME_AVAILABILITY.md`. The AI service response contract allows local text extraction to succeed when optional structured suggestions are unavailable.

## Completed scope

### Phases 0–4 — Foundations and data model

- Repository, React/TypeScript/Vite frontend, Express/TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL/Prisma foundation, and design system.
- Authentication with bcrypt hashes, server-side sessions, signed HTTP-only cookies, and protected routes.
- Explicit user-owned models for documents, subscriptions, recurring payments, purchases, warranties, renewals, deadlines, inbox items, notifications, and audit events.

### Phases 5–9 — Private records and commitments

- Private Vault uploads and metadata, current and prior document versions, and authenticated downloads/deletion.
- Subscriptions and recurring payments; purchases and optional receipt links; one warranty per purchase; renewals and deadlines with optional document associations.
- File type signature checks, upload-size limits, generated storage keys, private local storage, and ownership-scoped operations.

### Phases 10–12 — Attention and financial views

- Derived Action Center for overdue and near-term items, without a duplicate action-item store.
- Derived chronological Timeline across supported records.
- Derived financial commitment windows for 7, 30, and 365 days, grouped by currency without cross-currency conversion or ledger behavior.

### Phases 13–15 — Search, AI, and daily workflow

- Authenticated deterministic search and structured Life Inbox capture/triage with private file storage.
- Optional isolated FastAPI service for text extraction, local OCR, and validated structured suggestions. Backend retains ownership and write authority; suggestions require user confirmation.
- Authenticated Command Center navigation/actions and in-app notifications derived from Action Center sources.

## Phase 16 — Production Hardening + Release

**Objective:** Verify the existing product, address genuine release blockers, document actual behavior, audit publication safety, and publish the final planned release to the existing repository.

**Scope:**

- Security and ownership review across authentication, API routes, file handling, AI boundaries, database access, and configuration.
- Backend and AI test suites, frontend typecheck/build, Prisma validation/generation/migration status, and repository checks.
- Integration and regression review of existing flows, date behavior, file access, search, AI confirmation, notifications, and financial aggregation.
- Small, low-risk UI fixes only for obvious defects; no redesign or new product domains.
- Final environment documentation, README, plan, context, and tracked-file safety review.
- Commit and normal push to the existing `master` branch only after all required checks and audits pass; verify the published commit and contents.

**Deployment position:** No Docker configuration is included. `SDD.md` places Docker work outside the original completed product phases; this release uses documented local service setup and does not add deployment infrastructure or cloud hosting.

**Status:** Final planned phase. Release execution and its final verification are recorded in `Context.md` and the release handoff.

## Product and implementation principles

- Keep user-owned records and private files scoped to the authenticated account.
- Keep Action Center, Timeline, and financial summaries derived from existing domain data rather than duplicating business records.
- Keep AI optional and outside the database boundary; treat its output as untrusted suggestions requiring user confirmation.
- Do not commit credentials, `.env` files, private documents, or generated private storage.
- Do not use real personal documents in tests, demos, or screenshots.
- Avoid unrelated features, broad rewrites, and unnecessary deployment infrastructure.

## Project authorities

- `SRS.md` — product requirements and boundaries.
- `SDD.md` — architecture and security direction.
- `Context.md` — current codebase, verification, known limitations, and final release state.
- `README.md` — public project overview and setup instructions.
