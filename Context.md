# Avenoryn — Context

**Purpose:** Living implementation state for agents and developers. Read this before writing code.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-12 (Phase 16 final quality pass)

## Current quality-pass handoff (2026-10-12)

- **Status:** IN PROGRESS. Rebrand, isolated database checks, backend and AI-service tests, frontend builds, desktop/mobile Playwright checks, and dependency audit are complete. A clean non-OneDrive install verifies Prisma generation; generation inside this OneDrive checkout still fails at the engine rename. GitHub repository rename is still a required manual action before pushing.
- **Identity:** Avenoryn; repository slug intended as `avenoryn`. Preliminary public-web screening and uncertainty are recorded in `docs/NAME_AVAILABILITY.md`.
- **Git state:** final audit began on branch `master` at HEAD `22561643bdf37f62460b5e7fd0eabcdb6feb002f`. The reviewed changes are now included in the local release commit on `master`; origin remains `https://github.com/harryfernando10/LifeOS.git`. The pre-existing backend package edits were reviewed and retained, with Prisma versions aligned as described below.
- **AI repair:** the user confirmed local document extraction visibly succeeds in the actual UI after restarting the backend, frontend, and FastAPI service. The most likely explanation for the earlier disabled-configuration response is stale process configuration: backend `dotenv.config()` and AI `load_dotenv()` read environment values at process startup, and Vite reads its environment at startup; changing `.env` files does not update already-running processes. Provider credentials remain unset; this confirms local extraction only, not a live external AI-provider call. The README now documents a reliable three-terminal startup sequence.
- **OCR:** `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe` reports version `5.5.3.20260724`. Real synthetic image and scanned-PDF OCR tests pass.
- **Database isolation:** PostgreSQL 18 service `postgresql-x64-18` is running on `localhost:5432`. The configured development database `lifeos` was checked read-only; its account can create databases. A new empty `avenoryn_test` database was verified before migration. All Prisma checks, migrations, backend tests, and Playwright runs used a process-only test `DATABASE_URL` derived from `backend/.env`. `.env` was not overwritten; the development database was not migrated, reset, truncated, or dropped.
- **Database-backed verification:** all five migrations are applied to `avenoryn_test`; Prisma reports it up to date. Latest backend `npm test`: **78 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** across 14 suites. Backend typecheck and build pass.
- **Release:** local commit `Finalize Avenoryn release quality pass` is complete. No push or repository rename has been performed. GitHub CLI was not found in PATH; the manual rename of the existing repository remains pending.

### Quality-pass work and verification (2026-10-12)

- **Brand:** Avenoryn is now used in the live header, document title/metadata, current docs, package names, and examples. The repo-wide remaining-name categories are documented in `docs/NAME_AVAILABILITY.md`. The old GitHub URL remains because the remote has not been renamed. Existing `lifeos.sid` cookie name is retained for session compatibility.
- **AI changes:** Backend and AI-service examples now explain loopback setup and shared token configuration. The ignored backend `.env` gained `AI_SERVICE_URL` and a newly generated shared token; `ai-service/.env` was created from its example and given the matching token and local `TESSERACT_CMD`. No prior environment values were replaced. The provider remains disabled and no provider credential was configured.
- **AI behavior:** The service now returns extracted text with `suggestion: null` and a safe explanation when the external provider is disabled or errors. The backend validates that contract. The Inbox UI shows extracted text and says structured suggestions are unavailable instead of reporting total failure. Added a configuration-aware `/ready` route and specific safe diagnostics for missing settings, unreachable service, and token mismatch.
- **Observed live integration:** Started FastAPI bound to `127.0.0.1:8000`, sent a synthetic text PDF through the authenticated HTTP endpoint, confirmed `pdf-text`, marker `41628`, `suggestion: null`, `external_provider_used: false`, and `/ready` status 200. The temporary service process was stopped after verification.
- **Prisma:** the pre-existing working-tree edit had CLI/engines 6.12.0 with `@prisma/client` 6.19.3. A clean install showed that Prisma generated a 6.12.0 Client against the 6.19.3 runtime package. I aligned CLI and Client to **6.12.0**, preserving the chosen CLI downgrade and fixing the reproducible version mismatch; `npm audit` then reported **0 vulnerabilities** (the 6.19 CLI had three high findings through `@prisma/config`/`deepmerge-ts`). A clean temporary install outside OneDrive generated the aligned client, validated the schema, and found the isolated database up to date. Backend tests passed there, 78/78. Generation in the actual OneDrive checkout still fails with `EPERM` renaming `backend/node_modules/prisma/query_engine-windows.dll.node`; the same matching version generated successfully outside OneDrive. No inspected Node process had the query engine loaded, though OneDrive or endpoint protection locking cannot be ruled out. The live backend on port 3001 was left running and its dependencies were not replaced.
- **Frontend and Playwright:** frontend typecheck/build pass. Playwright run after adding cross-user download/version checks: **2 passed, 0 failed** across desktop Chromium and 390px mobile Chromium. The single scenario covers registration, protected-route redirect, sign-out/sign-in, Vault upload/version-history/current download, subscription, purchase/warranty, financial page, renewal/deadline creation, Timeline navigation, Inbox capture/triage with persisted status, search, derived notifications, Ctrl+K open/close, reload persistence, cross-user document-list isolation and 404s for cross-user download/version listing, and horizontal overflow checks. Eight principal pages are captured at both viewports in ignored `frontend/test-results/`. Console errors were limited to unauthenticated `/api/auth/me` probes; no failed browser requests were recorded. Playwright does not exercise the AI review/confirmation UI or assert Timeline/financial values beyond rendered records/pages.
- **Visual QA fix:** mobile inspection found Vault horizontal overflow at 390px. The grid/detail children now constrain their minimum width and long titles wrap. Final mobile overflow assertions pass. Desktop/mobile screenshots were inspected for Home, Vault, Commitments/Purchases, Financial, Renewals/Deadlines, Timeline, Inbox, and Search.
- **AI tests:** AI service `unittest` rerun outside the sandbox: **13 passed, 0 failed**, including real local Tesseract on synthetic image and scanned-PDF inputs, direct text-PDF extraction, disabled-provider behavior, and mocked provider failure. A sandboxed run stalled at Windows `TestClient` startup; the same suite passed in the normal local environment. Backend AI coverage includes mocked suggestions and confirmation through domain services. A prior live local FastAPI HTTP check returned extracted synthetic text with `suggestion: null`, `external_provider_used: false`, and `/ready` 200; the user has now confirmed extraction in the actual UI after service restarts. No external provider credential is configured; no live external call was made. Browser-level AI confirmation was not exercised.
- **Repository/artifact audit:** `git diff --check` passes. The staged-path audit covered 50 intended source/docs/test files and found no credential-shaped matches, real `.env` files, private files, browser auth state, or generated screenshots. Playwright screenshots/results and `backend/.e2e-private-storage/` remain ignored synthetic test artifacts. No secret values were printed. GitHub CLI is unavailable; current origin remains `https://github.com/harryfernando10/LifeOS.git` with upstream `origin/master`. No push or repository rename has been performed.
- **Next steps:** rename the existing GitHub repository manually in Settings to `Avenoryn` (do not create a duplicate). After that rename, update and verify `origin` as `https://github.com/harryfernando10/Avenoryn.git`, verify upstream, and push the local release commit without force. The local OneDrive-only Prisma rename failure remains recorded; matching-version generation and backend tests passed in an isolated non-OneDrive copy.

## Current Phase

Phase 16 — Production Hardening + Release (checks passed; final commit and publication pending at this snapshot)

## Status

The original 2026-10-04 Phase 16 snapshot referenced checkpoint `3f4893137911549f5929c275f5bda787dbc52583`. The 2026-10-04 and 2026-10-11 entries below are historical records; the 2026-10-12 quality-pass handoff above is authoritative for current branch, HEAD, environment, database, and test state.

### Final architecture and release snapshot

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS. Authenticated areas include Home/Action Center, Search, Vault, Commitments, Financial Commitments, Renewals, Timeline, and Life Inbox. Command Center and notifications are mounted in the application shell.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL. Controllers delegate to services; Prisma-backed domain data and local private storage are accessed only by the backend.
- **Data model:** User and server-side Session; Document and DocumentVersion; Subscription and RecurringPayment; Purchase and optional one-to-one Warranty; Renewal and Deadline; InboxItem with optional owned Document association; Notification and AuditLog. Action Center, Timeline, financial overview, and notifications derive from domain records rather than a duplicate business ledger/action store.
- **API areas:** `/api/auth`, `/api/documents` (including versions), `/api/subscriptions`, `/api/recurring-payments`, `/api/purchases` (and warranty), `/api/renewals`, `/api/deadlines`, `/api/action-center`, `/api/timeline`, `/api/financial-commitments`, `/api/search`, `/api/inbox`, `/api/ai`, and `/api/notifications`.
- **Frontend areas:** `/app/home`, `/app/search`, `/app/vault`, `/app/commitments`, `/app/financial`, `/app/renewals`, `/app/timeline`, `/app/inbox`; authenticated application shell also provides Command Center and notification controls.
- **AI/OCR:** Optional FastAPI service with no database access. It extracts text from PDFs or uses local Tesseract OCR for images/scanned PDFs. A configured external OpenAI-compatible provider receives extracted text for suggestions. The backend validates responses, retains ownership and write authority, and requires user confirmation for changes.
- **Security decisions:** bcrypt password hashes; signed HTTP-only `SameSite=Lax` cookies with `Secure` in production; database-backed expiring sessions; authentication rate limits; Helmet; configured credentialed CORS plus exact-Origin validation for state-changing browser requests; user-scoped queries; generated private storage keys; upload size, extension/MIME, and signature checks; no public file serving; generic client errors for unexpected exceptions.
- **Deployment:** no Docker or cloud deployment artifacts. Local services are run separately. Production operation requires operator-provided HTTPS, environment secrets, persistent private storage, database and file backups, and correct origin/database configuration.
- **Environment names:** `PORT`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, optional `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`, `SESSION_MAX_AGE_MS`, `PRIVATE_STORAGE_ROOT`, `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `AI_SERVICE_URL`, `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_API_BASE_URL`, and `TESSERACT_CMD`. Example files contain placeholders only.

### Phase 16 verification record (2026-10-04)

- Backend `npm test`: 78/78 passed after adding exact-Origin validation for state-changing browser requests.
- Backend `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm run prisma:validate` and `npm run prisma:generate`: passed.
- `npm run prisma:deploy`: passed; five migrations found, none pending in the configured local database.
- Frontend `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`: passed. No dedicated frontend test script exists.
- AI service `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m unittest -v`: 11/11 passed. PyMuPDF emitted SWIG deprecation warnings.
- At the time of the original 2026-10-04 snapshot, the Tesseract executable could not be found. The executable is present in the 2026-10-11 environment; see the current quality-pass handoff for fresh synthetic OCR results as they are completed.
- `git ls-files` and the final diff were reviewed. Tracked files contain expected source, migrations, tests, examples, and docs; credential-pattern matches are limited to synthetic test passwords. Ignore checks confirmed `.env`, node_modules, builds, Python virtual environment, caches, logs, and private-storage contents are excluded. No local private files were read or staged.
- UI reviewed from source. No obvious high-impact visual defect justified a design change; no browser-based visual review was performed in this environment.
- Phase 16 code change: added `backend/src/middleware/validateRequestOrigin.ts` and two integration checks in `backend/src/security/origin.test.ts`; registered the guard for unsafe requests and updated the authentication rate-limit comment to remove its obsolete future-phase reference.

### Final release checklist

- [x] Verify expected checkpoint, branch, clean working tree, and existing remote.
- [x] Run backend, frontend, AI-service, Prisma, and migration checks available in this environment.
- [x] Update README and consolidate the development roadmap to Phases 0–16.
- [x] Finish the final security, tracked-file, diff, and documentation audit.
- [ ] Create one final commit: `chore: finalize Avenoryn for release`.
- [ ] Push `master` normally to the existing `origin` and verify local `master` matches `origin/master`.
- [ ] Record final GitHub publication state in the release handoff.

  - Unit/integration coverage passes with mocked provider/OCR; real Tesseract 5.5.3 verified against synthetic image, scanned PDF, and text PDF

## Phase 15 implementation details

- **Command Center architecture:** `frontend/src/components/layout/CommandCenter.tsx` is mounted by the authenticated `AppShell`. The shell owns Ctrl+K/Cmd+K handling, ignores input/textarea/select/contenteditable focus, and restores prior focus on close. Commands navigate via React Router and pass add actions to existing Vault, Commitments, and Renewals forms. Search results use the existing authenticated Search API; no parallel search service was added.
- **Commands:** Home/Action Center, Vault/Add document, Commitments/Add subscription/Add recurring payment/Purchases, Financial Commitments/upcoming payments, Renewals/Deadlines, Timeline, Inbox/Add item/AI review, Search, overdue items, upcoming deadlines/renewals, and expiring-document attention navigation. AI processing remains in its existing Inbox review workflow; no new AI endpoint was added.
- **Notification architecture:** `backend/src/services/notificationService.ts` calls `getActionCenterForUser`, so source selection and timing remain in Action Center (overdue plus inclusive next 30 UTC days). It reuses the existing `Notification` table and deduplicates by owner + source type + source id + due date. Stale derived reminders are removed when their Action Center item disappears.
- **Notification sources:** deadlines, renewals, document expiry, active subscriptions, active recurring payments, and warranty expiry. Navigation uses fixed existing routes only; no storage paths or invented detail routes are exposed.
- **API endpoints:** `GET /api/notifications` (items and unread count, refreshing derived records); `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read`; `PATCH /api/notifications/read-all`. All routes require a session and scope rows to `req.authUser.id`.
- **Frontend:** `CommandCenter`, `NotificationsButton`, and `api/notifications.ts` are mounted in the existing authenticated app shell. Existing `/app/*` routes are reused; query params open existing Vault, Commitment, Renewal, and Deadline forms. Search accepts an initial `q` query.
- **Database/migration:** reused the existing `Notification` model. Added nullable `source_due_on` date, nullable `dismissed_at` timestamp, and a unique composite source/date index. Migration `20261003090000_phase15_notifications` is applied locally. No notification scheduler, email delivery, or duplicate attention model was added.
- **Tests/results:** full backend suite: 76 passed, 0 failed. Prisma validate/generate, backend typecheck/build, frontend typecheck/build, and `git diff --check` pass. No frontend test runner exists in this repository.
- **Security:** authenticated routes; user id comes only from the session; owner-scoped list and mutations; internal hrefs come from fixed mappings; source items use Action Center's owner-scoped queries; no private storage paths are returned. Mutations still use existing domain APIs and validation.
- **Known limitations:** notifications refresh when the user opens the bell or app shell, not through a background scheduler. Only in-app reminders exist. Commands are deterministic. The user selects an Inbox item before invoking the existing AI review.
- **Git:** branch `master`; completion commit subject `feat: complete phase 15 - command center and notifications`; local only, not pushed.

## Next Phase

Phase 16 — Production Hardening + Release

---

## How to run

Requires Node.js 22+, npm, and a local PostgreSQL database.

```bash
cd backend && npm install && npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Health: http://localhost:3001/api/health
- Ready: http://localhost:3001/api/ready
- Frontend talks to the backend via `/api` (Vite proxy)

Copy env examples before first run:

- `frontend/.env.example` → `frontend/.env`
- `backend/.env.example` → `backend/.env`

Optional AI service setup (AI remains off until configured):

```bash
cd ai-service
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Copy `ai-service/.env.example` to `ai-service/.env` and set a shared random `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` in both AI service and backend environments. Set `AI_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the backend. For AI suggestions only, configure `AI_PROVIDER=openai_compatible`, `AI_API_KEY`, and `AI_MODEL` inside the AI service. Tesseract OCR executable must also be installed locally (or configured with `TESSERACT_CMD`). Do not commit any `.env` files.

Required backend env: `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET` (min 32 characters). Never commit `.env` files.

Optional vault env:

- `PRIVATE_STORAGE_ROOT` (default `../private-storage` relative to backend cwd)
- `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (default `10485760` = 10 MiB)

---

## Authentication architecture (Phase 3 decision)

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Server-side sessions in PostgreSQL (`sessions` table) |
| Cookie | HTTP-only, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production, signed with `SESSION_SECRET` (HMAC-SHA256) |
| Password hashing | bcrypt, cost factor 12 |
| Password rules | 8–72 characters; email trimmed + lowercased |
| Identity on request | `req.authUser` (`id`, `email` only) — never trust client-supplied user ids |
| CSRF | `SameSite=Lax` cookies plus exact-Origin validation for state-changing browser requests; requests without Origin remain available to non-browser clients |
| Rate limiting | `express-rate-limit` on register/login (30 / 15 min) |
| Security headers | `helmet` on the API |
| Deferred | OAuth, email verification, password reset, MFA, social login |

Logout deletes the server session and clears the cookie.

---

## Phase 4 data model decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Inheritance | Explicit tables per SDD; no `LifeItem` base table |
| Financial commitments | Derived from `Subscription` + `RecurringPayment` (no separate finance/ledger table) |
| Memberships | Represented as Subscription and/or RecurringPayment rows |
| Warranty cardinality | At most one Warranty per Purchase (`purchaseId` unique) |
| Document associations | Optional FKs: Purchase.receiptDocumentId; Renewal/Deadline.linkedDocumentId |
| File storage | `DocumentVersion` / `InboxItem` storage metadata fields only; uploads in Phase 5 |
| Money | `Decimal(12,2)` with default currency `INR` |
| Ownership | Direct `userId` on all listed user-owned models; DocumentVersion owned via Document |
| Action Center / Timeline | Not stored entities — future derived queries |

### Entities introduced

- Document, DocumentVersion
- Subscription, RecurringPayment
- Purchase, Warranty
- Deadline, Renewal
- InboxItem, Notification, AuditLog

### Important enums

`DocumentCategory`, `DocumentStatus`, `BillingInterval`, `CommitmentStatus`, `DeadlineStatus`, `RenewalKind`, `RenewalStatus`, `InboxItemStatus`, `NotificationType`

### Migration

`20261002092710_core_domain_model`

---

## Phase 5 vault / documents decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Storage | Private local filesystem via `FileStorageService` abstraction (not PostgreSQL BLOBs; not Express static) |
| Layout | `private-storage/{userId}/{documentId}/{versionId}` — storage key is relative; absolute paths never returned to clients |
| Versioning (Phase 5) | Upload creates Document + DocumentVersion `versionNumber=1`, `isCurrent=true`. Download uses current version only |
| Version history UI / replace | Implemented in Phase 6 |
| File types | PDF, JPEG, PNG, WEBP (magic-byte detection + extension/MIME hints) |
| Size limit | `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` env (default 10 MiB) |
| Upload stack | `multer` memory storage → validate → store file → Prisma transaction; orphan file cleanup on DB failure |
| Authorization | Every document query filters by `userId` from `req.authUser`; `assertOwnership` retained |
| Categories | Existing Prisma `DocumentCategory` enum (no duplicated taxonomy) |
| Audit | `DOCUMENT_CREATED`, `DOCUMENT_UPDATED`, `DOCUMENT_DELETED` |

### Document API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/documents` | Yes | List current user's documents |
| GET | `/api/documents/:id` | Yes | Get one owned document (+ current version metadata) |
| POST | `/api/documents` | Yes | Multipart upload (`file` + metadata fields) |
| PATCH | `/api/documents/:id` | Yes | Update metadata |
| DELETE | `/api/documents/:id` | Yes | Delete document + versions + stored files |
| GET | `/api/documents/:id/download` | Yes | Download current version bytes (attachment) |

### Intentionally deferred (later phases)

- OCR / AI extraction / receipt intelligence
- Life Inbox processing
- Global search / Ctrl+K / Action Center / Timeline / notifications
- External cloud storage providers
- Document sharing / public URLs

---

## Phase 6 document versioning decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Schema | Reused Phase 4 `DocumentVersion` (no new migration) |
| Current marker | Exactly one `isCurrent=true` after replace; previous current gets `replacedAt` |
| Version numbers | Monotonic integers per document (`versionNumber` unique with documentId) |
| Storage | Same `FileStorageService` layout; new versionId → new storage key (no overwrite) |
| Consistency | Store file first, then DB transaction; delete orphan file if DB fails |
| Authorization | Parent Document `userId` gate; version endpoints return 404 for non-owners |
| API surface | List / create / download-by-version only (no separate delete-version) |
| Audit | `DOCUMENT_VERSION_CREATED` |
| Response safety | Never expose `storageKey` or absolute paths |

### Version API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/documents/:id/versions` | Yes | List versions (newest first) |
| POST | `/api/documents/:id/versions` | Yes | Multipart replace (`file`, optional `notes`) |
| GET | `/api/documents/:id/versions/:versionId/download` | Yes | Download a specific owned version |

### Frontend

- Vault detail panel: version history list, current badge, upload new version, per-version download
- Existing current-version download retained

### Intentionally deferred

- OCR / AI / search / sharing / Action Center / Timeline / notifications
- Deleting individual historical versions (document delete removes all)

---

## Phase 7 commitments decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Models | Reused Phase 4 `Subscription` + `RecurringPayment` (no new migration) |
| Memberships | Represented as subscription and/or recurring payment rows (FR-COM-01) |
| Action URLs | Optional http(s) URLs; UI opens in new tab; never treated as payment integration |
| Money | Decimal strings with up to 2 places; default currency `INR` |
| Status | `ACTIVE` / `PAUSED` / `CANCELLED` via existing `CommitmentStatus` |
| Authorization | All queries filter by `req.authUser.id`; non-owners get 404 |
| API surface | Separate `/subscriptions` and `/recurring-payments` CRUD |
| Deferred | Action Center aggregation, reminders, auto-renewal, financial 7/30/365 overview |

### Commitment API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/subscriptions` | Yes | List / create |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/subscriptions/:id` | Yes | Read / update / delete |
| GET/POST | `/api/recurring-payments` | Yes | List / create |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/recurring-payments/:id` | Yes | Read / update / delete |

### Frontend

- `/app/commitments` functional UI with Subscriptions and Recurring payments tabs
- Create/edit forms, detail panel, external action URL link, delete

---

## Phase 8 purchases & warranties decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Models | Reused Phase 4 `Purchase` + `Warranty` (no new migration) |
| Warranty cardinality | At most one warranty per purchase (`purchaseId` unique); upsert via PUT |
| Receipt link | Optional `receiptDocumentId` → owned Vault Document; unique per document |
| Receipt validation | Document must belong to same user; foreign/unknown ids rejected |
| Authorization | All purchase queries filter by `req.authUser.id`; warranty gated through owned purchase; non-owners get 404 |
| Money | Decimal strings with up to 2 places; default currency `INR` |
| Expiry | Warranty `endsOn` required; `startsOn` optional; startsOn cannot be after endsOn |
| Audit | `PURCHASE_*`, `WARRANTY_*` actions |
| Deferred | OCR, receipt intelligence, AI extraction, Action Center warranty aggregation, shopping marketplace |

### Purchase / warranty API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/purchases` | Yes | List / create |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/purchases/:id` | Yes | Read / update / delete (cascade deletes warranty) |
| PUT | `/api/purchases/:id/warranty` | Yes | Create or update warranty for purchase |
| DELETE | `/api/purchases/:id/warranty` | Yes | Remove warranty; returns updated purchase |

### Frontend

- `/app/commitments` adds a Purchases tab
- `PurchasesPanel`: list/empty/create/edit/detail, warranty form, receipt document selector from Vault

### Intentionally deferred

- OCR / receipt intelligence (Phase 16)

## Phase 9 renewals & deadlines decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Models | Reused Phase 4 `Renewal` + `Deadline` (no new migration) |
| Renewal kinds | User data via `RenewalKind` enum (passport, licence, insurance, domain, etc.) — not hardcoded product modules |
| Document link | Optional `linkedDocumentId` → owned Vault Document (not unique; SetNull on document delete) |
| Document validation | Document must belong to same user; foreign/unknown ids rejected |
| Authorization | All queries filter by `req.authUser.id`; non-owners get 404 |
| Action URLs | Optional http/https URLs stored; opened externally in UI |
| Defaults | Renewal status `UPCOMING`, kind `OTHER`; Deadline status `OPEN` |
| Audit | `RENEWAL_*`, `DEADLINE_*` actions |
| Deferred | Action Center / Timeline aggregation (Phases 10–11), reminders |

### Renewal / deadline API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/renewals` | Yes | List / create |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/renewals/:id` | Yes | Read / update / delete |
| GET/POST | `/api/deadlines` | Yes | List / create |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/deadlines/:id` | Yes | Read / update / delete |

### Frontend

- `/app/renewals` with Renewals + Deadlines tabs
- List/empty/create/edit/detail; optional Vault document selector; external action URL links
- Nav item "Renewals" in AppShell

### Intentionally deferred

- Action Center aggregation of overdue renewals/deadlines (Phase 10)
- Timeline chronological view (Phase 11)
- In-app reminders / notifications (Phase 15+)

---

## Phase 10 Action Center decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence | **Derived** aggregation — no `ActionItem` table (SDD: Action Center is a derived view) |
| Endpoint | `GET /api/action-center` (auth required) |
| Urgency | `overdue` (date before today UTC) vs `upcoming` (today through window end) |
| Window | **30 days** upcoming horizon (specs leave windows unfinalized; smallest practical choice) |
| Sources | OPEN deadlines; UPCOMING/DUE renewals; ACTIVE/EXPIRED documents with `expiresOn`; ACTIVE subscriptions with `nextBillingOn`; ACTIVE recurring payments with `nextDueOn`; warranties by `endsOn` |
| Exclusions | COMPLETED/CANCELLED deadlines/renewals; PAUSED/CANCELLED commitments; ARCHIVED documents; records beyond the 30-day window; null due dates |
| Sort | Overdue first, then due date ascending, then title |
| Navigation | `href` to existing shell routes (`/app/renewals`, `/app/vault`, `/app/commitments`); optional external `actionUrl` |
| Authorization | Every underlying query filters by `req.authUser.id` |
| Deferred | Timeline (Phase 11), notifications/reminders, importance scoring, financial 7/30/365 overview (Phase 12), caching |

### Action Center API

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/action-center` | Yes | Unified attention list for current user |

### Frontend

- `/app/home` loads Action Center (loading / empty / error / calm list)
- Shows urgency, source type, title, detail, due date, Open link, optional external action URL

### Intentionally deferred

- Financial 7/30/365 commitment overview (Phase 12)
- Notifications / push / email (Phase 15+)
- Search / Ctrl+K (Phase 13)
- Configurable attention windows / importance scores

---

## Phase 11 Timeline decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence | **Derived** aggregation — no `TimelineEvent` table (SDD: Timeline is a derived view) |
| Endpoint | `GET /api/timeline` (auth required) |
| Window | **Past 365 + next 365 days** (specs leave ranges unfinalized; sensible default, documented here) |
| Sources (FR-TL-01) | Deadlines (`dueOn`); renewals (`dueOn`); ACTIVE/EXPIRED documents with `expiresOn`; subscriptions with `nextBillingOn`; recurring payments with `nextDueOn`; warranties by `endsOn` |
| Exclusions | ARCHIVED documents; records outside the ±365-day window; null optional dates (`nextBillingOn`, `nextDueOn`, `expiresOn`) |
| Status scope | Broader than Action Center: deadlines/renewals of any status (including COMPLETED) appear as historical/scheduled events; commitments included whenever a date is set |
| Sort | Chronological ascending by date, then type, then title |
| Temporal labels | `past` / `today` / `upcoming` relative to UTC start-of-day |
| Date handling | `@db.Date` fields serialized as `YYYY-MM-DD` via UTC ISO slice; no invented times |
| Recurrence | **No expansion** — one entry per stored `nextBillingOn` / `nextDueOn` (algorithm deferred; not a calendar product) |
| Navigation | `href` to existing shell routes; optional external `actionUrl` when present |
| Authorization | Every underlying query filters by `req.authUser.id` |
| UI filters | None in this phase (All/Past/Upcoming tabs deferred; specs do not require them yet) |
| Deferred | Configurable ranges, recurrence expansion, purchase/document-upload events, Phase 12 financial windows |

### Timeline API

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/timeline` | Yes | Chronological event list for current user |

### Frontend

- `/app/timeline` loads Timeline (loading / empty / error / chronological list)
- Nav item "Timeline" already present in AppShell (Phase 1); wired to functional page
- Shows temporal badge, type, status, title, detail, date, Open link, optional external action URL

### Intentionally deferred

- Configurable Timeline ranges / type filters
- Recurrence occurrence expansion on Timeline (financial expansion lives in Phase 12)
- Purchase dates / document upload events (not in FR-TL-01)
- Notifications / Search / Ctrl+K

---

## Phase 12 Financial Commitments decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence | **Derived** aggregation — no finance/ledger/budget table (SDD + FR-FIN-02) |
| Endpoint | `GET /api/financial-commitments` (auth required) |
| Windows (FR-FIN-01) | Next **7 / 30 / 365** days; inclusive UTC range `[today, today+N]` (same day-boundary style as Action Center’s 30-day window) |
| Sources | **ACTIVE** `Subscription` (`nextBillingOn`) + **ACTIVE** `RecurringPayment` (`nextDueOn`) only |
| Exclusions | PAUSED/CANCELLED commitments; null next due/billing date; purchases; warranties; one-time amounts |
| Recurrence | Known intervals (WEEKLY/MONTHLY/QUARTERLY/YEARLY) expand from stored next date through window end; overdue next dates advance forward into the window. **CUSTOM**: at most the single stored next date (no invented schedule) |
| Double-counting | One occurrence id per `{sourceType}:{sourceId}:{YYYY-MM-DD}`; subscriptions and recurring payments are separate sources never merged |
| Amount / currency | Amounts as `Decimal` strings (`toFixed(2)`); totals grouped **by currency** with **no FX conversion**; null amounts listed but excluded from numeric totals |
| Date handling | UTC start-of-day; `@db.Date` as `YYYY-MM-DD`; range end inclusive |
| Authorization | Every query filters by `req.authUser.id` |
| UI | Dedicated `/app/financial` route + AppShell nav (minimal overview; not budgeting) |
| Deferred | Budgets, investments, banking, FX conversion, Home embed of financial summary, editing amounts from this page |

### Financial API

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/financial-commitments` | Yes | Three windows with totals + occurrence lists |

### Frontend

- `/app/financial` loads Financial commitments (loading / empty / error / window tabs + list)
- Nav item "Financial" in AppShell
- Shows per-currency totals, occurrence amount/due date, Open → Commitments, optional external action URL

### Intentionally deferred

- Budgets / investment / banking (explicitly out of scope — FR-FIN-02)
- Exchange-rate conversion
- Embedding financial summary on Home
- Search (Phase 13) / Inbox (Phase 14) / notifications

- Do not push unless explicitly requested

## Known issues / blockers

- Prisma may log expected unique-constraint errors for duplicate registration / duplicate warranty tests (handled)
- No standalone CSRF token; state-changing browser requests are protected by exact-Origin validation and `SameSite=Lax` cookies.
- No email verification / password reset (intentionally deferred)

## Architectural decisions

- Cool slate canvas + muted teal accent (Phase 1)
- HTTP-only cookie sessions stored in PostgreSQL (Phase 3)
- Explicit relational domain model without LifeItem inheritance (Phase 4)
- Private filesystem storage behind a replaceable service abstraction (Phase 5)
- Version replace reuses DocumentVersion + private storage; no second storage system (Phase 6)
- Commitments are Subscription + RecurringPayment only — not an accounting system (Phase 7)
- Purchases reuse Phase 4 Purchase/Warranty; receipt links to existing Vault documents only — no OCR (Phase 8)
- Renewals/Deadlines reuse Phase 4 models; kinds are enum data, not product modules; no fake payment/renewal (Phase 9)
- Action Center is a derived query service over owned records — not a stored ActionItem entity; 30-day upcoming window (Phase 10)
- Timeline is a derived chronological query over owned FR-TL-01 sources — not a stored TimelineEvent entity; ±365-day default window; no recurrence expansion (Phase 11)
- Financial commitments overview is a derived 7/30/365 aggregation over ACTIVE subscriptions + recurring payments with interval expansion; not a budget/ledger; purchases excluded (Phase 12)
- Search returns deterministic grouped results from existing user-owned records; result links target existing feature routes because those features do not have entity-specific routes.
- Life Inbox uses the existing InboxItem table and statuses, stores uploaded PDF/image files in private storage, and can associate an owned Vault document.

## Historical next-phase marker

The original Phase 14 handoff pointed to Phase 15. This marker is superseded by the Phase 16 release snapshot at the top of this file.

## Canonical product reminder

Avenoryn is a unified personal life-administration system.

> Calendar tells you when. Avenoryn tells you what, why, where, and what to do next.

Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite + React Router + Tailwind (frontend); Node.js + Express + TypeScript (backend); PostgreSQL + Prisma; optional Python/FastAPI AI after core works; private local file storage first.

Protected routes: `/app/home`, `/app/vault`, `/app/commitments`, `/app/financial`, `/app/renewals`, `/app/timeline`, `/app/inbox`.

Phase 13 also adds `/app/search` inside the existing authenticated shell.

AI is a suggestion layer. Core app must work if AI is unavailable. AI must not access the database.

## Phase 13 handoff (2026-10-03)

- **Status:** Complete; Phase 13 implementation committed locally.
- **Completed:** Global deterministic search with query validation, grouped typed results and existing-area navigation; structured Inbox create/list/filter/read/update/triage/delete; optional private PDF/JPEG/PNG/WEBP uploads using the existing storage service and upload limits; optional Vault document association validated against authenticated ownership; audit events for Inbox mutations; authenticated shell integration.
- **Remaining:** Entity-specific detail routes do not exist, so search navigation opens each entity's existing feature area. Search is SQL `contains` over current domain fields with bounded result counts; no external index or ranking.
- **Database:** Added optional `InboxItem.linkedDocumentId` relation to Document (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) and index. Migration `backend/prisma/migrations/20261003100000_inbox_document_link/migration.sql` applied to local database. Prisma client regenerated. No other schema changes.
- **API:** `GET /api/search?q=...`; `GET/POST /api/inbox` (POST accepts structured JSON or multipart file); `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/inbox/:id`; `GET /api/inbox/:id/download`; `PATCH /api/inbox/:id/triage`. All require the existing session authentication.
- **Frontend:** Added `/app/search`, Search navigation entry, SearchPage, functional InboxPage. Both routes are nested beneath ProtectedRoute and AppShell.
- **Tests:** Added `backend/src/searchInbox/searchInbox.test.ts` covering authentication, validation, empty search, entity groups, ownership isolation, Inbox CRUD/triage/filter, document association ownership, and not-found behavior.
- **Verification:** `cd backend && npm run prisma:generate`, `npm run prisma:validate`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm test`; `cd frontend && npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`. The complete backend suite passes 67/67 tests. Initial sandbox test invocation failed in Node `os.userInfo()`; the same test command outside the sandbox passed.
- **Files created:** `backend/prisma/migrations/20261003100000_inbox_document_link/migration.sql`; `backend/src/controllers/searchInboxController.ts`; `backend/src/routes/searchInboxRoutes.ts`; `backend/src/searchInbox/searchInbox.test.ts`; `backend/src/services/inboxService.ts`; `backend/src/services/searchService.ts`; `backend/src/validators/searchInboxValidators.ts`; `frontend/src/api/searchInbox.ts`; `frontend/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`.
- **Files modified:** `Context.md`; `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`; `backend/src/routes/index.ts`; `frontend/src/App.tsx`; `frontend/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`; `frontend/src/pages/InboxPage.tsx`.
- **Architectural decisions:** Search composes existing Prisma models in one service; inbox reuses InboxItem and its status enum, adding only the needed Vault association; private attachments use the existing FileStorageService and validated PDF/image upload path; storage keys are never returned; all domain queries carry `userId` from the authenticated request; manual triage maps to existing statuses (`UNREVIEWED`, `CATEGORIZED`, `DISMISSED`).
- **Git:** Branch `master`; latest commit is this focused Phase 13 handoff commit (HEAD); working tree is clean after commit.
- **Next phase:** Phase 14 — AI Intelligence.

---

## Phase 14 handoff (2026-10-03)

- **Status:** COMPLETE.
- **Completed:** Optional FastAPI service; backend-authenticated processing for owned Inbox items and Vault documents; PDF text extraction before OCR fallback; image OCR path for JPEG/PNG/WEBP; structured document/receipt suggestion contract; backend revalidation; Inbox review/edit/reject UI; explicit Vault document confirmation; confirmed Purchase creation through existing Purchase API; optional Warranty upsert only when the user opts in and supplies/confirms an end date. AI failures, missing configuration, unsupported/corrupt files, empty text, provider failures, malformed responses, and OCR unavailability return explicit errors.
- **Remaining/blocker:** No Phase 14 implementation remains. No live AI provider or API key is configured; this is optional by design. AI provider behavior is verified using mocks. The local `TESSERACT_CMD` was set only in verification process environments; the machine-specific executable path is not in tracked source/configuration.
- **AI architecture:** React calls Express only. Express requires session authentication, retrieves files only after `userId` ownership filters, reads bytes using `FileStorageService`, and calls `AI_SERVICE_URL/v1/process` using the private shared `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN`. The FastAPI service has no database or storage access. Non-loopback AI-service and provider URLs require HTTPS. The configured OpenAI-compatible provider receives extracted text only; images and original files are processed by the local OCR service. Provider-specific HTTP/JSON handling is isolated in `ai-service/main.py`.
- **OCR architecture:** pypdf extracts text from text-based PDFs. Empty-text PDFs are rendered page-by-page with PyMuPDF and OCRed with Pillow + pytesseract; image files go directly to local OCR. Scanned PDFs are limited to 20 pages per request; images above 40 megapixels are rejected. Tesseract can be selected with `TESSERACT_CMD`. The original file remains unchanged in private storage. OCR output is transient and returned only to the owning user.
- **Provider expectations:** `AI_PROVIDER=none` is the default, so requests fail clearly with `AI_UNAVAILABLE`; no fake output is returned. The only adapter implemented is `openai_compatible`, requiring a configured key and model in the AI service. Tests use deterministic mocks; no API call or paid provider is required to run the core app. UI explains that content may be sent to the configured external provider.
- **Environment variables introduced:** Backend `AI_SERVICE_URL`, `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN`. AI service `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_API_BASE_URL`, `TESSERACT_CMD`. Examples are in root/backend `.env.example` and `ai-service/.env.example`; no secret values are stored in tracked files.
- **Database/migrations:** None. Existing `Document`, `DocumentVersion`, `InboxItem`, `Purchase`, `Warranty`, and `AuditLog` are reused. Extracted text and suggestions are not persisted. Confirmation calls existing Document/Purchase/Warranty domain logic and audit logging.
- **API:** `POST /api/ai/inbox/:id/process`; `POST /api/ai/documents/:id/process`; `POST /api/ai/inbox/:id/confirm-document`. All require existing session auth. Purchase and Warranty confirmation use existing `POST /api/purchases` and `PUT /api/purchases/:id/warranty` endpoints.
- **Frontend:** `AIInboxReview` is integrated into the existing protected `/app/inbox` page. It exposes idle, processing, errors, extracted text, editable document/receipt suggestions, reject, confirmation, and optional warranty form. Existing Vault documents can be linked to Inbox and processed from that review. No new route was added.
- **Result contract:** `AIProcessResponse` contains `extractedText`, `textSource` (`pdf-text` or `ocr`), `externalProviderUsed`, and a discriminated `suggestion.kind` (`document` or `receipt`). Document values use the existing `DocumentCategory` enum and supported Document fields. Receipt values map to Purchase fields. Warranty values are optional and accepted only as suggestions; Avenoryn never infers a warranty duration. Both service and Node reject malformed output.
- **Real OCR verification:** Tesseract reported version `5.5.3.20260724`. A synthetic PNG containing `LIFEOS OCR TEST 4829` returned exactly `LIFEOS OCR TEST 4829`. A synthetic image-based PDF followed the `ocr` path and returned `LIFEOS OCR TEST 4829`. A synthetic text PDF followed the `pdf-text` path and returned `SYNTHETIC TEXT PDF 7316`. Temporary fixtures were created outside the repository and removed automatically. `TESSERACT_CMD` was set only for these local commands; no machine-specific value was saved in project files.
- **Tests/results:** `backend/src/ai/ai.test.ts` adds 8 mocked integration tests covering auth, ownership, unavailable configuration, validated suggestions, malformed output, no mutation before confirmation, Vault/Purchase confirmation, explicit and absent warranty dates, and document ownership. `ai-service/test_main.py` has 11 unit tests covering text PDF, scanned PDF/image OCR paths with mocked OCR, missing Tesseract, OCR failure, unsupported/corrupt files, empty text, AI unavailable/provider failure, malformed suggestions, and service-token enforcement. `backend npm test`: 75/75 pass. Python `python -m unittest -v`: 11/11 pass (with local Tesseract path configured). Prisma validate/generate pass. Backend/frontend typechecks and builds pass. `git diff --check` passes.
- **Security/privacy:** No frontend API key; raw paths/storage keys are not returned; service token is shared only through environment variables; no AI-side database access; files remain private and are read only after owner checks; API calls are HTTPS outside loopback; provider sends extracted text only; user confirms before any domain writes; writes use existing validators, ownership checks, and audits; provider tests are mocked. Existing `.env` files and private-storage contents were not staged or inspected for values.
- **Git:** Branch `master`; latest commit is the focused `feat: complete phase 14 - ai intelligence` handoff commit (`HEAD`); nothing was pushed.
- **Next:** Phase 15 — Command Center + Notifications.
